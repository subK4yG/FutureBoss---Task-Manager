# FutureBoss – Dharma Task Manager

## Project Overview

FutureBoss – Dharma Task Manager is a React-based productivity app inspired by the timeless wisdom of the Mahabharat and Ramayan.
It’s designed to help users:
- Track daily duties (“Dharma”)
- Gamify productivity with Karma points
- Stay motivated with epic quotes
- Keep tasks persistent across sessions
- Receive AI-powered task suggestions based on priority

This is more than a Todo app — it’s a digital guide for disciplined, purpose-driven action.

## Why This Project?

Most productivity apps focus only on task completion.  
FutureBoss focuses on **intentional action** — inspired by the idea of Dharma (duty) and Karma (action).

This project demonstrates:
- Component-driven UI design in React
- Clean state management with hooks
- AI-driven prioritization
- User psychology through thematic UX
- Portfolio-ready application
