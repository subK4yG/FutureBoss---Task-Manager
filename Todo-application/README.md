# FutureBoss – Dharma Task Manager

# Project Overview

FutureBoss – Dharma Task Manager is a React-based productivity app inspired by the timeless wisdom of the Mahabharat and Ramayan.
It’s designed to help users:
+ Track daily duties (“Dharma”)
+ Gamify productivity with Karma points
+ Stay motivated with epic quotes
+ Keep tasks persistent across sessions.
  
This is more than a Todo app — it’s a digital guide for disciplined, purpose-driven action.
