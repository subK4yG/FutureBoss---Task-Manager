# FutureBoss – Dharma Task Manager

## Project Overview

FutureBoss – Dharma Task Manager is a React-based productivity app inspired by the timeless wisdom of the Mahabharat and Ramayan.
It’s designed to help users:
+ Track daily duties (“Dharma”)
+ Gamify productivity with Karma points
+ Stay motivated with epic quotes
+ Keep tasks persistent across sessions.
  
This is more than a Todo app — it’s a digital guide for disciplined, purpose-driven action.

## Why This Project?

Most productivity apps focus only on task completion.
FutureBoss focuses on **intentional action** — inspired by the idea of Dharma (duty) and Karma (action).

This project was built to explore:
- Component-driven UI design in React
- Clean state management with hooks
- User psychology through thematic UX
- Building a memorable, portfolio-ready application

The project demonstrates how thoughtful UX and psychology-driven design can improve engagement beyond basic task tracking.

## Future Scope

FutureBoss can evolve into a full-scale productivity and focus platform by introducing:

- Role-based task views (Student / Professional / Team)

The architecture is intentionally modular to support gradual scaling without major refactoring.
